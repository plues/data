Changes for Evaluation:

Filled in some missing event data

Pandas excel parsing seems to fill in some fields when loading columns with the same name -> This might lead to links between coures and modules being created when there suould be none.

WiWi import dropps some information, e.g. block seminars, empty event data etc. Hence we might loose information in some cases.


Deleted WiWi:

Deleted S-Modules (amongh them MQ04 / MQ05 / MQV01 - Teil 2 and MQV01) and MW33 which are all irrelevant for the validation
